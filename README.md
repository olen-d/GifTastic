# GifTastic
Demonstration project working with theGIPHY API

This project allows users to view animated GIFs from Giphy, based on topics organized around the theme of photography. It uses the Giphy API to get the GIFs and CSS flex and grid to lay out the topic buttons and resulting GIFs. 

The project is a good tool to learn about accessing APIs, as well as modern CSS layout options.

The project is maintained by Olen Daelhousen
